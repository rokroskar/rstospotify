rstospotify
===========

Make [Radio Student](http://www.radiostudent.si) set lists magically appear as spotify playlists.

Definitely not bug-free -- if you see some dubious tracks appear like something from Miley Cyrus or Don McLean the search failed for some reason. Sometimes the set lists are in a funny format and don't parse well so the playlist creation will fail.
